    "This assignment transitions you from NumPy's numerical array operations to Pandas' powerful tabular data manipulation. While NumPy excels at homogeneous numerical arrays, Pandas is designed for the heterogeneous, labeled data that characterizes most real-world datasets—mixing dates, categories, numbers, and text within the same table.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll work with real bike share data from Chicago's Divvy system to answer questions about urban transportation patterns. Through three progressively complex problems—exploring usage patterns, analyzing rider behavior, and conducting temporal analysis—you'll discover why Pandas has become the standard tool for data analysis in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "The assignment emphasizes Pandas' design philosophy: named column access, explicit indexing methods (loc/iloc), handling missing data, and method chaining for readable data pipelines. You'll also see how Pandas builds on NumPy while adding the structure and convenience needed for practical data science work.\n",

    "## Answer\n",
    "1.  Started_at was set to be an object which would have made accessing this data difficult since they are not date times nor numbers. No calculations would have been possible.\n",
    "2. I think the IDs are similar to the git commit IDs where they're a finger print and contain the information about the station.\n",
    "3. Method chaining is combining multiple methods into one line of code. It works by starting with the furtherest left method, completes it and moves to the next method and continues until all the methods are completed.\n",
    "4. I think the missing 10% could come from the fact that not all members started at or ended at a station. I think this could be solved by either putting in a value that represents not starting or ending at a station or use the coordinates to find the station closests to the start and end location."

    "## Answer\n",
    "1. The difference between 2a.3 and 2b.3 is the types being used for the data. I think the difference between the two methods is one is using deep while the other is not. .info() is only basing the memory usage off of the types and not the actual data.\n",
    "2. The 30% overhead removes 4.8GB so that leaves 11.2GB. The optimistic is 11.2GB/5 = 2.24GB and the conservative is 11.2GB/10 = 1.12GB. I would recommend staying below 2GB to give some safety RAM. Personally I think it depends on who is using the system. I know I tend to open a lot of tabs when I work which eats a lot of my RAM so I try to edge of the side of caution. I would probably try to stay below 1.75GB."

    "## Answers\n",
    "1. This makes formatting more readable because each line represents a different method and if they were not it would be one long line that is difficult to understand. With the methods more spread out it is easier to see what line is causing in error. A downslide is the code gains many lines and could make it difficult to see all the methods.\n",
    "2. The pickle perserved the datetimes while the CSV lost them. This is significant because I can immediately use the datetime in another code while using the CSV would require converting the types.\n",
    "3. I would use CSV when I need a universal data set or I want to be able to actually read the data. Otherwise the pickle takes up less storage and the speed difference could become a facter with a large enought data set.\n",
    "4. I did not have to change my code for it to work. I believe the difference between the two is one has explicit ands while the original uses method chaining to get the results."

    "1. NumPy vs. Pandas\n",
    "    1. The biggest shift to me was how more specific and finicy data frames feel to use. The errors also feel much less helpful to me and caused me some difficutly debugging. \n",
    "    2. To me the hardest part was trying to use masks and indexing properly. Followed by learning that indexed datetime values don't need to have .dt\n",
    "2. Real Data Experience\n",
    "    1. This felt more difficult to use and I had more instances of questioning if I did something right. I think it gets harder to check my work when real data is used.\n",
    "    2. I think once I get used to the methods and how to properly use them. Pandas will be much more efficient. I do think Pandas feels more cumbersome to use compared to NumPy but that may change with time.\n",
    "3. Learning and Application\n",
    "    1. I think learning about all the methods and how to apply them will be the most useful or learning about using Git and Git Hub. Both are going to be a huge help in the future\n",
    "    2. Right now I feel like a 6~7. I feel like I am going to need to fiddle a lot with Pandas to get it to do what I want and I think I just need to spend more time using to increase my score. Pandas just hasn't clicked with me compared to NumPy. There might be something to say about learning about NumPy has caused me to think about Pandas in an unhelpful way.\n",
    "4. Feedback\n",
    "    1. I believe this took me about 10 hours to complete in total. I got way more errors from working on this code compared to the other homeworks\n",
    "    2. I think the most helpful part is setting up a repository and learning how to use it, followed by actually using pandas.\n",
    "    3. I think maybe adding a section about errors and how to use them to problem solve may be helpful. Most of the time the errors feel to large to understand and it took me awhile to figure out how to properly read them.\n"
